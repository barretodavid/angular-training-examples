# \*ngFor

## Purpose

- Demonstrate how to iterate over arrays and iterables in Angular 2's templates

## Exercises

- Iterate over a custom array
- Observe the `let <item> of <collection>` syntax and the ability to use `<item>` in the template.  Also observe that `let of` is ES6 syntax
- Learn about `index`, `even`, `odd`, `first`, and `last`
- Iterate over an iterable (not an array)
- Ensure that POJO's are not iterable
- Optionally learn about track-by
